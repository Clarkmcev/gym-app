# Proprio

Proprio is a Fullstack Real Estate application allowing you to find your dream property or sell your dusty flat in no time! This CRUD app has been developed to give you all you need to create, edit and comment offers. This project is part of a 3 projects I did through a full remote 9 weeks Web-development Bootcamp at Ironhack.

The user can register, login, logout and edit his profile page. Once logged, he can browse around the website and look for some property offers. By clicking on any of them, some details of each offer is accessible. If interested the user can add the offer to its favorites and even look at the user who posted the offer to get his contact informations. Users can also comment on each other's profiles to check the relevance of the people.
